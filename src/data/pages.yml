        <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.
            I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.</p>
        <p>I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
            I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
        <p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
            foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass
            by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz
            of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies,
            then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath.</p>
